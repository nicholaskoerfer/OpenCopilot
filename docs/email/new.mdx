Open can also provide email support with:

- **AI drafted email responses** that can be used to send a personalized response to your customers.
- **It can take actions** using the actions feature ([learn more](/taking-action)).
- The email conversation **will be transcribed into text** and will show up in the Open inbox.
- The human agent will be able to see all email support conversations in the Open inbox.
- You will not need to open your email inbox to see the conversation.

### Forwarding Your support@yourcompany.com Email to Open

1. From the Open dashboard, add a new email address to your account.
2. Depending on your email provider, you will need to forward your support@yourcompany.com emails to forwarding@opencopilot.so.
   - Gmail: Go to Settings > Forwarding and POP/IMAP > Add another POP/IMAP server. Enter the email address you want to forward as forwarding@opencopilot.so and the address of your Open account.
   - Outlook: Go to Settings > Accounts and Import > Add another account. Enter the email address you want to forward to Open and the address of your Open account.
3. Once done, you will be able to see all your emails in the Open inbox and see how the AI responds to your emails.

### Email Handoff

Similar to other channels, if the AI is unable to respond to your email, you can hand off the email to a human agent. The human agent will be able to see the email and respond to it.

<Warning>
This is a beta feature and might not work as expected. Please reach out to us at [mo@opencopilot.so](mailto:mo@opencopilot.so) if you have any questions.
