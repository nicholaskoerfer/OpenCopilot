The chat widget enables you to interact with the Copilot from your dashboard and see the changes in real-time. Open is a React web app that you can embed in your web app.

### Using simple js script

1. By using CDN script into your html file.
   ```html
   <script src="https://unpkg.com/@openchatai/widget@latest/dist-embed/pilot.js"></script>
   ```
   this will automatically register a new function called `initAiCoPilot` on the global window object.

2. Init the copilot (when document fully loads) by calling the `initAiCoPilot` function and passing the required options.
    There are plenty of options that you can pass to the copilot, you can find them [here](#options)
   ```html
   <script>
     const options = {
        apiUrl: "https://api-v2.opencopilot.so/backend",
        socketUrl: "https://api-v2.opencopilot.so",
        initialMessage: "Hey! happy to help.", 
        token: "your_copilot_token_goes_here", // you can get your token from the dashboard
      }
      window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", ()=>initAiCoPilot(options)); // window.onload
   </script>
   ```

### As a React Component

1. Install the widget from npm.

   <Tabs>
     <Tab title="npm">
     ```bash
      npm install @openchatai/widget 
      ```
      </Tab>
     <Tab title="yarn">
     ```bash
      yarn add @openchatai/widget 
      ```
      </Tab>
     <Tab title="pnpm">
     ```bash 
     pnpm add @openchatai/widget 
     ```
     </Tab>
   </Tabs>

2. Use the Component inside your application

```jsx
import { CopilotWidget,Root } from "@openchatai/widget"; 
const options = {
  apiUrl: "https://api-v2.opencopilot.so/backend",
  socketUrl: "https://api-v2.opencopilot.so", 
  initialMessage: "Hey! happy to help.",
  token: "your_copilot_token_goes_here", // you can get your token from the dashboard
}
function Widget(){
  return (
    <Root options={options}>
    <CopilotWidget />
    </Root>
  )
}
```

## Identifying chat users/contacts

One of the helpful options in the chat widget is the ability to identify the user/contact of the chat. This is useful if you want to track the usage of the chat widget.

To start identifying the user/contact, you can pass the `user` object as an option to the chat widget, for example:

```jsx
const options = {
  apiUrl: "https://api-v2.opencopilot.so/backend",
  socketUrl: "https://api-v2.opencopilot.so",
  initialMessage: "Hey! happy to help.", 
  token: "your_copilot_token_goes_here",
  user: {
    name: "your_user_name",
    email: "your_user_email",
    avatar: "your_user_avatar_url",
    phone: "your_user_phone",
    customData: {
      // any custom data you want to send to the copilot backend 
      "key1": "value1",
    }
  },
}
```

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The copilot widget is not showing up">
    Make sure that the `triggerSelector` is correct and the element exists in
    the dom,instead you can set `defaultOpen` to `true` to make the copilot open by default.
    if that did not work, please [open an issue on our GitHub repo](https://github.com/openchatai/OpenCopilot/issues/new)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The copilot widget is so small">
    The copilot widget is responsive and it's width is set to 100% by default of the container, you can change that by passing the
    `containerProps` option and setting the width to whatever you want.
