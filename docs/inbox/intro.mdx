**(_Everything is in a single place, no matter what channel you are using - email, chat, phone, etc._)**

Inbox is a centralized place to view, manage, and take action on your customer support conversations across all your channels (email, chat, phone, etc.).

- You will be able to see all your customer support conversations in one place.
- You can take action on your conversations from the Inbox (reply, change status, add notes, share, etc.).

### Types of Inboxes:

- **Assigned to Me** - Any conversation you have with a customer assigned to you.
- **Assigned to Copilot** - Any conversation that is being handled by the AI.
- **Unassigned** - Any conversation that is not assigned to you or the AI.
- **Everything** - All conversations.
