@todo video

You can ingest your knowledge base into Open in two ways:

- **From the dashboard**: You can upload your knowledge base (PDF, XLSX, DOC, TXT) or provide your own URL to the knowledge base, and Open will ingest it.
- **Or you can use the API to programmatically** upload and ingest your knowledge base ([learn more](/api-reference/endpoint/ingest-knowldge-from-file)).

We support multiple API operations to ingest your knowledge base. You can use the API to ingest your knowledge base in the following ways:

- **Ingest from a URL**: You can provide a URL to the knowledge base, and Open will ingest it.
- **Ingest from a file**: You can upload your knowledge base (PDF, XLSX, DOC, TXT) or provide your own URL to the knowledge base, and Open will ingest it.
- **Delete a knowledge base**: You can delete a knowledge base from Open.
- **Get a knowledge base**: You can get a knowledge base from Open.
