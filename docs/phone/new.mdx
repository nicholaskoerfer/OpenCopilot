Open can also provide phone support with:

- **Extra realistic AI voice** that can understand and respond to your customer's questions on the phone.
- **It can take actions** using the actions feature ([learn more](/taking-action)).
- The phone conversation **will be recorded and transcribed into text** and will show up in the Open inbox.
- The **AI can transfer the conversation to a human agent** if the customer is not satisfied with the response.

### Buying a Phone Number

To get started with phone support, you can buy a phone number from the dashboard, which will generate a US phone number for you.

From there, you can change the AI base prompt to be more relevant to your business, making the phone support more effective.

### Changing the Base Prompt

You can change the base prompt to be more relevant to your business, making the phone support more effective. In general, keep in mind the following:

- The base prompt should be short and concise (Remember that the conversation will be on the phone).
- Avoid using complex terms and try to keep it simple.
- Try to give the AI a clear understanding of what you want it to do (by providing action, knowledge base, and other information).

### Handing Off to a Human Agent

If the customer is not satisfied with the response, the AI can transfer the conversation to a human agent. This is called handing off to a human agent.
